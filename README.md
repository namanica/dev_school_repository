a little talk about me
----------------------
~~sometimes it is hard to talk about yourself~~

***but i will try to, forgetting about all insecurities***

*My name is* **Veronica** *and I am **17** years old*

**This year** _brought a lot of interesting changes in my life._ 

_Obviously I am talking about my_ **university** _and people surrounding me now._

Here is the list of my favourite emoji:
+ :blush: only to express positivity
+ :heart_eyes: for smth I extremely liked
+ :no_mouth: when I have nothing to say
+ :neutral_face: when I am confused
+ :pensive: when i am frustrated 
+ :nail_care: do I need to say anything? SLAY
